The third tab available to the logged-in user is the calendar tab. It serves
for managing special events (adding, editing, deleting). The calendar is generated on the
the client application using a JavaScript function. The calendar has buttons to switch the view
for the previous and next month. It has the form of a table with days marked with the appropriate
colour (the current day and days with a scheduled event).


When you want to add a new event, click on the desired date. Once you have added an event, hovering over its day with the mouse brings up a tooltip displaying a list of events linked to that date. Next to each of these events
button is generated for deleting and editing it.
